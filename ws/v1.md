## Websocket API

The SRA Websocket API is meant to supplement the [REST API](https://github.com/0xProject/standard-relayer-api/blob/master/http/v1.md) by providing updates without resorting to polling.

### Orders Channel

#### Request messages

##### Subscribe

[See payload schema](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-monorepo/blob/development/packages/json-schemas/schemas/relayer_api_orders_channel_subscribe_schema.ts#L1)

Minimum request:
```
{
    "type": "subscribe",
    "channel": "orders",
    "requestId": "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426655440000"
}
```
This will subscribe to all new orders and order state changes in the orderbook.

Filtered request:
```
{
    "type": "subscribe",
    "channel": "orders",
    "requestId": "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426655440000",
    "payload": {
        "makerAssetData": "0xf47261b04c32345ced77393b3530b1eed0f346429d",
        "takerAssetData": "0x0257179264389b814a946f3e92105513705ca6b990",
        "networkId": 42,
    }
}
```
This will subscribe to all new Kovan orders and Kovan order state changes in the orderbook with `makerAssetData` and `takerAssetData` equal to the values specified in the subscribe request.

**Parameters**

General:
*   `requestId`: a string uuid that will be sent back by the server in response messages so the client can appropriately respond when multiple subscriptions are made
*   `networkId`: the Ethereum network id to which you'd like to subscribe. Default is 1 (mainnet). (optional)
   
Networks and their Ids:

| Network Id| Network Name |
| ----------| ------------ |
| 1         | Mainnet      |
| 42        | Kovan        |
| 3         | Ropsten      |
| 4         | Rinkeby      |

Filter parameters (optional): 
*   `makerAssetType`: subscribes to new orders where the maker asset is of certain asset type (example: `ERC20`, `ERC721`)
*   `takerAssetType`:  subscribes to new orders where the taker asset is of certain asset type (example: `ERC20`, `ERC721`)
*   `makerAssetAddress`: subscribes to new orders where the contract address for the maker asset matches the value specified
*   `takerAssetAddress`: subscribes to new orders where the contract address for the taker asset matches the value specified

Order specific parameters (optional):
*   `makerAssetData`: subscribes to new orders with the specified makerAssetData
*   `takerAssetData`: subscribes to new orders with the specified takerAssetData
*   `traderAssetData`: subscribes to new orders where either makerAssetData or takerAssetData has the value specified

While there is some redundancy in supporting maker/takerAssetType, maker/takerAssetAddress, and maker/takerAssetData, they are actually all needed. For example, you cannot query "all ERC712 orders", or "all Cryptokitties orders", or "all ERC20 orders" with just maker/takerAssetData and need the other query params to do so.

#### Response messages

##### Update

This message is sent whenever the relayer receives a new order, or when the `remainingFillableAmount` of an order changes. The scenarios where an update is necessary include:
* The relayer received a new order.
* An order was fully or partially filled, so `remainingFillableAmount` has changed.
* The maker of the order no longer has sufficient tokens to fulfill the order, so `remainingFillableAmount` changes to the maximum amount that is fillable by the maker. 
* The order is cancelled, so `remainingFillableAmount` is 0. 

An update is not necessary for order expiration, as that information can be derived from the `expirationTimeSeconds` field in the order.

Updates can be sent in bulk since the payload of the message specifies a collection of updated or new orders.
