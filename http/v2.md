## General

### Pagination

Requests that return potentially large collections should respond to the **?page** and **?perPage** parameters. For example:

```
curl https://api.example-relayer.com/v2/token_pairs?page=3&perPage=20
```

Page numbering should be 1-indexed, not 0-indexed. If a query provides an unreasonable (ie. too high) **perPage** value, the response can return a validation error as specified in the [errors section](#errors). If the query specifies a **page** that does not exist (ie. there are not enough **records**), the response should just return an empty **records** array.

All endpoints that are paginated should return a **total**, **page**, **perPage** and a **records** value in the top level of the collection.  The value of **total** should be the total number of records for a given query, whereas **records** should be an array representing the response to the query for that page. **page** and **perPage**, are the same values that were specified in the request. 

These requests include the [`asset_pairs`](#get-v2-asset-pairs), [`orders`](#get-v2-orders), and [`orderbook`](#get-v2-orderbook) endpoints.

### Network Id
All requests should be able to specify a **?networkId** query param for all supported networks. For example:
```
curl https://api.example-relayer.com/v2/token_pairs?networkId=1
```
If the query param is not provided, it should default to **1** (mainnet).

Networks and their Ids:

| Network Id| Network Name |
| ----------| ------------ |
| 1         | Mainnet      |
| 42        | Kovan        |
| 3         | Ropsten      |
| 4         | Rinkeby      |

 If a certain network is not supported, the response should **400**  as specified in the [error response](#error-response) section. For example:
 
```
{
    "code": 100,
    "reason": "Validation failed",
    "validationErrors": [
        {
            "field": "networkId",
            "code": 1006,
            "reason": "Network id 42 is not supported",
        }
    ]
}
```

### Link Header

A [Link Header](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5988) can be included in a response to provide clients with more context about paging
For example:

```
Link: <https://api.example-relayer.com/v2/token_pairs?page=3&perPage=20>; rel="next",
<https://api.github.com/user/repos?page=10&perPage=20>; rel="last"
```

This `Link` response header contains one or more Hypermedia link relations.

The possible `rel` values are:

| Name  | Description                                                   |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| next  | The link relation for the immediate next page of results.     |
| last  | The link relation for the last page of results.               |
| first | The link relation for the first page of results.              |
| prev  | The link relation for the immediate previous page of results. |

### Rate Limits

Rate limit guidance for clients can be optionally returned in the response headers:

| Header Name           | Description                                                                  |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| X-RateLimit-Limit     | The maximum number of requests you're permitted to make per hour.            |
| X-RateLimit-Remaining | The number of requests remaining in the current rate limit window.           |
| X-RateLimit-Reset     | The time at which the current rate limit window resets in UTC epoch seconds. |

For example:

```
curl -i https://api.example-relayer.com/v2/token_pairs
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Mon, 20 Oct 2017 12:30:06 GMT
Status: 200 OK
X-RateLimit-Limit: 60
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 56
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1372700873
```
When a rate limit is exceeded, a status of **429 Too Many Requests** should be returned.

### Errors

Unless the spec defines otherwise, errors to bad requests should respond with HTTP 4xx or status codes.

#### Common error codes

| Code | Reason                                  |
| ---- | --------------------------------------- |
| 400  | Bad Request â€“ Invalid request format    |
| 404  | Not found                               |
| 429  | Too many requests - Rate limit exceeded |
| 500  | Internal Server Error                   |
| 501  | Not Implemented                         |

#### Error reporting format
For all **400** responses, see the [error response schema](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-monorepo/blob/development/packages/json-schemas/schemas/relayer_api_error_response_schema.json#L1).

```
{
    "code": 101,
    "reason": "Validation failed",
    "validationErrors": [
        {
            "field": "maker",
            "code": 1002,
            "reason": "Invalid address"
        }
    ]
}
```

General error codes:

```
100 - Validation Failed
101 - Malformed JSON
102 - Order submission disabled
103 - Throttled
```

Validation error codes:

```
1000 - Required field
1001 - Incorrect format
1002 - Invalid address
1003 - Address not supported
1004 - Value out of range
1005 - Invalid signature or hash
1006 - Unsupported option
```


### Misc.

*   All requests and responses should be of **application/json** content type
*   All token amounts are sent in amounts of the smallest level of precision (base units). (e.g if a token has 18 decimal places, selling 1 token would show up as selling `'1000000000000000000'` units by this API).
*   All addresses are sent as lower-case (non-checksummed) Ethereum addresses with the `0x` prefix.
*   All parameters should use `lowerCamelCase`.

## REST API

### GET /v2/asset_pairs

Retrieves a list of available asset pairs and the information required to trade them. This endpoint should be [paginated](#pagination).

#### Parameters

*   assetDataA=&assetDataB [string]: these are assetData fields. Returns asset pairs that contain assetDataA and assetDataB (in any order). Setting only assetDataA or assetDataB returns pairs filtered by that asset only (optional)

#### Response

[See response schema](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-monorepo/blob/development/packages/json-schemas/schemas/relayer_api_asset_data_pairs_response_schema.json#L1)

            }
        },
        ...
    ]
}
```

*   `minAmount` - the minimum trade amount the relayer will accept
*   `maxAmount` - the maximum trade amount the relayer will accept
*   `precision` - the desired price precision a relayer would like to support within their orderbook
*   `assetData` - the assetData representing that token

### GET /v2/orders

Retrieves a list of orders given query parameters. This endpoint should be [paginated](#pagination). For querying an entire orderbook snapshot, the [orderbook endpoint](#get-v2orderbook) is recommended.

#### Parameters

Filter parameters:
  *   makerAssetProxyId [string]: returns orders where the maker asset is of certain [asset proxy id](https://0xproject.com/docs/0x.js#types-AssetProxyId) (example: `0xf47261b0` for `ERC20`, `0x02571792` for `ERC721`)
  *   takerAssetProxyId [string]:  returns orders where the taker asset is of certain [asset proxy id](https://0xproject.com/docs/0x.js#types-AssetProxyId)(example: `0xf47261b0` for `ERC20`, `0x02571792` for `ERC721`)
  *   makerAssetAddress [string] returns orders where the contract address for the maker asset matches the value specified
  *   takerAssetAddress [string] returns orders where the contract address for the taker asset matches the value specified

Order specific parameters:
  *   exchangeAddress [string]: returns orders created for this exchange address
  *   senderAddress [string]: returns orders with the specified senderAddress
  *   makerAssetData [string]: returns orders with the specified makerAssetData
  *   takerAssetData [string]: returns orders with the specified takerAssetData
  *   traderAssetData [string]: returns orders where either makerAssetData or takerAssetData has the value specified
  *   makerAddress [string]: returns orders with the specified makerAddress
  *   takerAddress [string]: returns orders with the specified takerAddress
  *   traderAddress [string]: returns orders where either makerAddress or takerAddress has the value specified
  *   feeRecipientAddress [string]: returns orders where feeRecipientAddress is feeRecipient address

All parameters are optional.

If both makerAssetData and takerAssetData are specified, returned orders will be sorted by price determined by (takerAssetAmount/makerAssetAmount) in ascending order. By default, orders returned by this endpoint are unsorted.

While there is some redundancy in supporting maker/takerAssetType, maker/takerAssetAddress, and maker/takerAssetData, they are actually all needed. For example, you cannot query "all ERC712 orders", or "all Cryptokitties orders", or "all ERC20 orders" with just maker/takerAssetData and need the other query params to do so.

*   `asks` - array of signed orders where `makerAssetData` is equal to `baseAssetData`

Bids will be sorted in descending order by price, and asks will be sorted in ascending order by price. Within the price sorted orders, the orders are further sorted by _taker fee price_ which is defined as the **takerFee** divided by **takerTokenAmount**. After _taker fee price_, orders are to be sorted by expiration in ascending order.

The way pagination works for this endpoint is that the **page** and **perPage** query params apply to both `bids` and `asks` collections, and if `page` * `perPage` > `total` for a certain collection, the `records` for that collection should just be empty. 

### POST /v2/order_config

Relayers have full discretion over the orders that they are willing to host on their orderbooks (e.g what fees they charge, etc...). In order for traders to discover their requirements programmatically, they can send an incomplete order to this endpoint and receive the missing fields, specifc to that order. This gives relayers a large amount of flexibility to tailor fees to unique traders, trading pairs and volume amounts. Submit a partial order and receive information required to complete the order: `senderAddress`, `feeRecipientAddress`, `makerFee`, `takerFee`.
